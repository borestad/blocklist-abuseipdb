Lists with worst IPv4 & IPv6 offenders _(~99% confidence)_, provided by
[AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) (with permission).

- Lists are updated multiple times per day.
- The repository is continously squashed to keep down size.

### Extra Features

- [`Statistics`](stats)
- [`Hall of Shame`](stats/hallofshame) ip lists with aggressive /24 subnets -
  i.e [`1`](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check-block/64.62.156.0/24)
  [`2`](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check-block/206.168.34.0/24)
  [`3`](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check-block/193.163.125.0/24)
- `ASN Database` from [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/products/free-ip-database)
  is used to decorate all IPs with metadata
- Selfhosted `honeypot` integration with verified abuse score (to get those
  pesky ~90% confidence offenders)

> **Disclaimer**:
>
> `#1` This repository is using the _"free forever"_ plan (5 fetches per day +
> 1000 ip lookups), but also aggregates the data from multiple publicly free &
> legal sources (also with free plan) to create a larger iplist.
>
> `#2` All credits goes to [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/). Please
> [support](https://www.abuseipdb.com/pricing) them. Seriously!
>
> `#3`
> [Use ip-blocking with caution](https://www.anura.io/blog/is-ip-blocking-effective).
> Firewalls should preferably use rules on the incoming WAN side
>
> `#4` Recommended usage is the
> [maximum 30 days](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borestad/blocklist-abuseipdb/main/abuseipdb-s100-30d.ipv4)
> or less to avoid false positives.
>
> `#5` Do _not_ use the `abuseipdb-s100-all.ipv4`. It is _only_ exposed for
> _statistical usage_.
>
> `#6` Regarding naming: s100 means ~100% confidence lists.
>
> `#7` IPv6 blocking is almost useless.
>
> _Public IPv6 addresses may implement the SLAAC privacy extension. With this,
> the interface identifier is randomly generated. The SLAAC privacy extension
> also implements a time out, which is configurable, so that the IPv6 interface
> addresses will be discarded and a new interface identifier is generated._
